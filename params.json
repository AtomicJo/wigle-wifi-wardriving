Light colors are networks seen before, purple ones are new for the local database.\r\n\r\nIf you have trouble logging in, or have suggestions, send us an email to wigle-admin@wigle.net and we'll be happy to help out.\r\n\r\nNeeds \"Reads Phone State\" in order to tell if a phone call is in progress, to mute the audio (sounds and speech).\r\n\r\nFiles are available to help with a human translation to non-english languages. This was mostly a mechanical translation, because we obviously don't know all these languages. You can help to improve things by making pull requests at:\r\nhttps://github.com/wiglenet/wigle-wifi-wardriving\r\nor sending to wigle-admin@wigle.net\r\n\r\nKeep on stumbling."}
